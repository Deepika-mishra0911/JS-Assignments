6. Rewrite the function using '?' or '||'
Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask them
to input again.
The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the
input/enters an empty line.
Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a special
handling for a non-numeric input in this task.
